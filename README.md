# backpropagationMNIST
Python 3 version of chapter 1, 3 code in http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.html

See the website for his licensing

This is a beginner's backpropagation neural network that reads in MNIST data and learns to read it with abouty 95% accuracy. See his website for the book, source and data files.

I've converted his code to a working Python 3 version but it needs a lot of tuning and clean up to be really useful.
